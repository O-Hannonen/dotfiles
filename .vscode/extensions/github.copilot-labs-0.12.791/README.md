# GitHub Copilot Labs

GitHub Copilot Labs is a companion extension to [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com) that houses experimental and up-and-coming features in a sidebar.

To learn more about GitHub Copilot Labs, [read our post](https://next.github.com/projects/copilot-labs/).

## Requirements

1. An active GitHub Copilot subscription. Visit the [Copilot Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart#signing-up-for-github-copilot) to learn more.
2. You must have the main extension of [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) installed alongside Labs.
3. You'll need to [sign up](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-labs/) and accept the [GitHub Next Pre-Release License Terms](https://github.com/githubnext/githubnext/blob/main/TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS.md).

## Usage

For now Copilot Labs consists of a VS Code sidebar that houses distinct features. Once the Copilot Labs extension is installed, you'll see a Copilot icon in the sidebar. Clicking on that will bring up all of the experiments in separate panels.
